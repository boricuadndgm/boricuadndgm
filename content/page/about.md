# Welcome to my adventure-filled realm!

Iâ€™m a passionate TTRPG enthusiast with a particular love for D&D 5e.
My journey through tabletop role-playing games has taken me from the bustling halls of GenCon to the cozy corners of my local library.
Presently, Iâ€™m working towards starting a recurring game at my local gaming store.
I'm also open to online play, using Foundry VTT and Discord for those who prefer a virtual adventure.

My style as a GM/DM leans towards a highly organized and narrative-driven approach.
I enjoy weaving together story arcs that can be part of a cohesive world.
While I enjoy the occasional one-shot session, I believe the more enjoyable experience comes from short adventures that may build bigger campaigns.
I tend to design my adventures with a central conflict or theme that represents the undertone for the villains' or antagonists' motivations.
I like to give attention to the villains as the opposing force tailored to the player characters.
My aim through these villains is to provide a compelling reason for the PCs to want to thwart their plans.

For new players, I prefer to run more directed adventures with a clear start and end, ensuring everyone can comfortably dive into the game.
For seasoned adventurers, I will enable a more sandbox-like style of play, providing goals for the player characters to achieve.
I do not describe my play style as a percentage of role-play and combat.
I believe that each adventure or campaign should have a healthy balance of both and should be tailored to the players' style.
However, I believe in the relationship between role-play as a way to motivate combat.
Combat is a way to express an encounter based on the narrative impact it can have.
Combat should have a goal, like providing treasure, weapons, artifacts, fame, etc.
The outcome of battle should relate to the role-play.

My influences are various folks in the community, chances are that if you like what they have to say then you will like playing with me.

I also enjoy drawing maps and creating interesting table props that make play more engaging.
These obviously take a lot of time and effort, but when I am able to, they feel like a very rewarding way to engage with players.

My expectations for players are simple: bring your creativity, enthusiasm, and willingness to collaborate.
Whether youâ€™re a veteran or a newcomer, I aim to create a welcoming, engaging, and exciting environment.
I encourage you to design characters that are eager to embark on adventures, seize opportunities, thwart villains' plans, save towns, and enjoy the rewards.

**Our Player-GM Contract**:
As a player, you should embrace the adventure hooks and be willing to share in the journey with your fellow players and the DM.
The characters you build should make sense in the world.
Whenever there is doubt, have a conversation.
Our goal is to have a good time.

Let the dice roll and the adventures unfold! ðŸš€ðŸŽ²ðŸ“œ
