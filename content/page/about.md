# Welcome to my adventure-filled realm!

Iâ€™m a passionate TTRPG enthusiast with a particular love for D&D 5e.
My journey through tabletop role-playing games has taken me from the bustling halls of GenCon to the cozy corners of my local library.
Presently, Iâ€™m working towards starting a recurring game at my local gaming store.
I'm also open to online play, using Foundry VTT and Discord for those who prefer a virtual adventure.

My GM/DM style leans towards an organized narrative-driven approach, where outcomes are determined by the characters' actions (and the dice rolls ðŸŽ²), but plot hooks are more or less defined through a rough outline.
I enjoy weaving together story arcs that can be part of a cohesive world.
This style allows me to prepare maps, props, NPCs, flavor text, etc., in advance.
While I enjoy the occasional one-shot session, I believe the more enjoyable experience comes from short adventures that may build bigger campaigns.
I tend to design my adventures with a central conflict or theme that represents the undertone for the villains' or antagonists' motivations.
I like to give attention to the villains as the opposing force tailored to the player characters.
My aim through these villains is to provide a compelling reason for the PCs to want to thwart their plans.

My goal or philosophy as a DM, my role is to render the world as the player characters experience it, representing the physics and nature of the world.
I expect characters to be interested in adventures for either intrinsic or extrinsic reasons.
I prefer to lay out hooks and scenarios that present conflicts or challenges to be overcome.
Surpassing these obstacles yields rewards (financial or otherwise) and allows the cycle to repeat.
Along the way, I introduce relevant NPCs and gradually reveal villains and their plans.
For new players, especially, I prefer to run more directed adventures with a clear start and end, ensuring everyone can comfortably dive into the game.

As the DM, I provide a central conflict or tension, competing factions, villain(s) or antagonist(s) with their schemes, and settings.
Players/characters pick sides in conflicts, favor some factions and ruin others, thwart evil plans, rescue the distressed, recover that which was lost, and more.

I do not describe my play style as a percentage of role-play and combat.
I believe that each adventure or campaign should have a healthy balance of both.
Combat is just one type of encounter characters will face.
In my view, the relationship is best described as role-play motivates combat.
Combat is a way to express an encounter based on the narrative impact it can have.
Combat should have a goal, like providing treasure, weapons, artifacts, fame, etc.
The outcome of battle should relate to the role-play.

My influences are various folks in the community, chances are that if you like what they have to say then you will like playing with me.
This is not meant to be a full list just a sample.

I also enjoy drawing maps and creating interesting table props that make play more engaging.
These obviously take a lot of time and effort, but when I am able to, they feel like a very rewarding way to engage with players.
If you like dungeon art, these are some of my influences:

My expectations for players are simple: bring your creativity, enthusiasm, and willingness to collaborate.
Whether youâ€™re a veteran or a newcomer, I aim to create a welcoming, engaging, and exciting environment.
I encourage you to design characters that are eager to embark on adventures, seize opportunities, thwart villains' plans, save towns, and enjoy the rewards.

**Our Player-GM Contract**:
As a player, you should embrace the adventure hooks and be willing to share in the journey with your fellow players and the DM.
The characters you build should make sense in the world.
Whenever there is doubt, have a conversation.
Our goal is to have a good time.

Let the dice roll and the adventures unfold! ðŸš€ðŸŽ²ðŸ“œ
