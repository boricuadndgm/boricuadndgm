# Code of Conduct

Generally, Please behave....

Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!
No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.

## Boundaries

## Let's Talk for a Minute

## Respect for Others

## A Fun Table for All
