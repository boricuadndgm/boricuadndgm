## 2025

### March

None. Working too much!

### April

#### Beginners D&D 5e - The Mine Cleanup Crew

Each session is about 2 to 2.5 hours. Starting at 7 pm CST and ending around 9:30 pm with a hard stop at 10 pm.
I like to leave a buffer for folks running late or for having a bit of time do some socializing.

- Session 0: Wednesday April 9 at 7 pm CST at Heroic Adventures
  - Kickstart adventure, cover character creation
- Session 1: Wednesday April 16 at 7 PM CST at Heroic Adventures
  - Get the adventure started or continue from previous session
- Session 2: Wednesday April 23 at 7 pm CST at Heroic Adventures
  - Continue from previous session
- Session 3: Wednesday April 30 at 7 pm CST at Heroic Adventures
  - Adventure conclusion

Please, [Respond to Google Form](https://forms.gle/EMD6rwXhPnH2Zcbi8) by the **Deadline for submissions is Monday April 7th, 2025**.
This is to help me have a head count of folks who can make it to the sessions.
