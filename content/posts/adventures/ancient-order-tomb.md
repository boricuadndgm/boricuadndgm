# The Entrance Guards

- The party can approach either from the road or from the foliage across the entrance.

- 2 **Goblins** guard the front gates.
  They are talking and complaining if overheard.
  They can be dispatched quickly; otherwise, if alerted they will shut the gate and blockade it.
  And will run inside to warn others. They will not stay and fight.

- A shut front gate is possible to force open with Athletics(STR DC 15).
  It is not a lock, it is a piece of wood across the handles.
  The front gate wall is climbable with some help Athletics(STR), Acrobatics (DEX) DC 12.

# The Mausoleum

> The heavy metal doors are closed but not locked or blocked.
  Entering the mausoleum you see on the left and right open graves and the floor littered with covering stones.
  Evidence that the remains stored inside were removed.
  At the end of the small hall, there is a set of stairs that go underground.

# The Offerings Hall

> A wide open room with a lit brazier in the middle. It is evident that several creatures have been living in this room.
  Scattered around the floor are food and tools, makeshift beds and cots.
  Also visible are many artifacts and mundane objects nothing of obvious major worth and presumably stolen.
  As you look to your left, there are 2 bronze statuses with their hands outstretched, as if to hold something.
  For both, the other hand holds a shield infront of them.

- PCs enter from the south. A locked door to the north. To the east a cement bench. To the west 2 bronze status and in between them a bas-relief.

  Goblins have been here fro weeks and are the culprits behind the local attacks, thefts, and kidnapings.

- The brazzier in the center is lit and surrounded by older offerings.
  Offerings include wilted flowers, small figurines, candles, etc.

- The bronze statues (which show oxidation but they seem to have been polished over recent years) are prominent Dragoon Knights (members of the ancient order).
  The inscriptions on the shield for one says "law" and the other "order" and underneath both the symbol of the Dragoon Knights (which looks like a dragon).

  - If players look around they can find a bronze scales (order) and bronze scroll bundle (law). This is only meant to take time ~5-10 mins per item.
    Use (Investigation INT DC 10 for each one), unless PCs have a general idea of what to look for (i.e. something bronze).
    This is meant to be easy to place the objects in the open hands and this will immediately unlock the door to the north.

    - Finding something of somewhat equal weights will also work, but will require both objects to be approximately equal in weight as the bronze objects. Investigation INT DC 15 will find something that matches without being the bronze objects.

- The west wall has a bas-relief of what looks like knights (Dragoons) fighting monstrous creatures.
  Many of the creatures depicted do not look like anything commonly seen.
  In the skies there also seems to be shapes of what resembles dragons. They also seem to be fighting the aberrations.
  At the bottom of the relief there is an inscription that reads:

    > In defense against the forces of chaos, enternaly in conflict with law and order.

- The north door has been locked. Solving the bronze statue puzzle will unlock it and silently. Silence is key to avoid detection.
  It can be unlocked with thieve's tools using DEX 14, but will take ~30-45 mins to accomplish. This option is silent.
  It can be forced open with Athletics STR 16, but this option will make a lot of noise and will break the statue mechanism.
  When broken, the statues lowere their arms and are locked in place, but the door cannot be locked again.

# The Hallway Traps

> The doorway opens to a completely dark hallway. The light from the bazier shines just a few feet infront of the door.
  Beyond that it is a dark and narrow corridor.

- If the party successfully stopped the Goblins from the entrance, you can add the line:
  > In the darkness you can hear some uninteligible and sourceless echos.

- Darkvision helps but not much, dim light from the door will still mean disadvantage on Perception WIS checks.
  PCs can light a torch and will see the traps laid out in front of them; however, if they approach the mess hall with a lit torch they will be detected.

## Oil slick trap

- Several feet into the hallway (but before the T intersection) there is a slick oil trap with pots and pans stacked.

  - __With a light source,__ the players immediately see the trap.
    Otherwise, to notice the trap it is a Perception WIS DC 15, and DEX DC 14 to avoid slipping.
    Failure means crashing into the pots and pans and making a lot of noise.

- At the T intersection, if the players go left, they will reach a door to the dormitories.
  Or, if the players go right, they will reach the mess hall where light is visible.

## Trip wire trap

- A few feet before the exit, there is another trap. This trap is a trip wire that goes up the wall and across the ceiling.
  At the ends of the wire there are 2 glass bottles. Each end having one bottled tied to it.
  If the trip wire is triggered the bottles will fall to the ground or smash against the walls and release their contents.
  The bottles release a smoke screen which will alert enemies and a toxic gas which will hurt players.

  - __With a light source,__ they immediately notice the tripwire trap and can easily bypass it or disable it.
    Optionally, disabling the trap is DEX DC 10, just for the sake of tension, makes a fumble fun.

  - __Without a light source,__ to detect the trap is Perception WIS or Investigation INT DC 15 with disadvantage (darvision rules).
    To disable the trap while in the darkness, needs a DC 16 check.

  - Successfully disabling the trap, means collecting the 2 bottles. Players can now use these items.

    - Bottle with orange liquid, creates an instantaneous thick smoke screen. The radius of the smoke screen is 15 ft.
      It lasts for 1 minute and quickly disperses after that. Can be dispsersed more quickly with some kind of wind effect.

    - Bottle with green liquid, releases an instantaneous plume of toxic gas which covers a radius of 10 ft.
      It very quickly dissapates within 18 seconds (3 rounds). It deals 1d10 poison damage at the start of the turn.

# The Dormitories

At the T intersection, if the players go left, they will reach a door to the dormitories.

> The room is completely dark and there are no light sources. A musty smell catches your nose. Sound also feels a little dampened here as if there was soft material.

- __In the dark,__ as PCs walk about, they feel like they find more beds and some night tables.

  > By walking around, you notice and stumble onto rectangular objects that feel like wood.

- __With a light source,__ PCs confirm this is a dormitory. This room is meant to provide information for the players. There's nothing of monetary value. Exploring the room will reveal secrets about the Order of Dragoon Knights.

  > A large number of bed frames and night stands adorn the room on each side.
  Many of the beds have their matresses and blankets removed.
  At a glance there are small artifacts such as spectacles, pictures, books, papers, journals.
  The walls have the occasional hanging painting and cloth banners which definitely show age and mold.
  Other than the beds, most of the objects in the room look undisturbed.

- Secrets can be found through exploring the room and assuming players read or observe in detail the object in the room.

  - A wax sealed letter from a knight to their family
  - A journal from an initiate to the order
  - A tattered banner displays a chalice with a drops dripping into it
  - A moldy painting with a brass, bronze, or gold dragon that is bestowing some kind of blessing to a group of villagers
  - A leather cloth that has a map burned in with text script etched onto the edges

## Secrets and Clues

- [ ] `Dark Water` is a tar like substance that has powerful magical properties. Prolonged exposure leads to insanity, corruption or death.
- [ ] The secret rite requires drinking from a special chalize `Dragon's Essence`, `Celestial's Essence`, and `Dark Water`.
- [ ] The rite is dangerous and has a risk of causing madness and sometimes even death. Not every initiate survives the rite.
- [ ] Surviving the rite earns you the title `Dragoon Knight` and the leaders of the order are called `Wardens`.
- [ ] The rite grants a protection against the corruptive effects of `dark water` and `creatures of chaos`.
- [ ] The protection is hereditary and can be passed on by a Dragoon Knight by imparting their own essence (a.k.a `Dragoon Knight's essence`).
- [ ] The `le Calice du Sang SacrÃ©` is needed to properly bestown the blessing; it was crafted by deities.
- [ ] Dragons and Celestials once helped humanoid mortals fight the creatures of chaos.

# The Mess Hall

At the T intersection, if the players go right, they will reach the mess hall where light is visible.
The room is guarded by a band of **Goblins**, **Hobgoblin(s)**, and **Bugbear(s)**. The numbers depend on the PC party.
Depending on the situation it is possible the party could ambush the enemies.

## Effects from the Hallway Traps

Enemies are aware, hidden, and prepared to ambush, if the PCs triggered any one of the conditions:

- The entrance guard goblins got away from the PCs successfully.
- The PCs triggered the pots and pans oil slick trap.
- The PCs triggered the trip wire and smoke screen trap.

__If an ambush is about to happen__, add the line:

> Suspiciosly the room appears empty. Suddenly, a creature yells and arrows and stones start flying.

__If all the conditions were avoided__, then the party can ambush the enemies. Add the lines:

> The previously noises seem to originate in this room. Voices laughing and speaking in what sounds like Goblin language.
  Peering into the room, various Goblinoids are eating, drinking, and shouting at each other as they pass time guarding the room.

## Mess Hall Brawl

**TODO** write battle setup guideline.

| Number of Characters | Character Level | Entrance Guards Escaped |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |
| Row 3    | Data 5   | Data 6   |


- Goblins are cowards. So long as there are greater than 2 Goblins, they will continue to fight.
  If there are 2 or less, they will run towards the north wall door and try to escape. Only applies to Goblins.

- It is possible to capture 1 or 2 Goblins to interrogate them. They have no loyalty when captured and will reveal whatever they now to the party.
  Interrogation can succeed with Intimidation CHA DC 10 and Persuasion CHA DC 12.

- Bugbears and hobgoblins do not surrender or run away. While they are still in battle Goblins will not run away no matter the number that remains.

### Stop that Goblin!

In the event a Goblin makes an escape through the north wall door, it will run (in 2 turns) towards the ceremonial chamber and warn others.

## Exploring After the Battle

> The mess hall is a large well lit room with three large pillars holding up the center. The walls are adorned with banners and paintings.
  At eye level, rows of tables littered with cups and plates with food scraps occupy the majority of the space.
  Towards the south there is a small kitchen with what seems to be a stove or furnace, a large cask, and a counter.
  To the north, there is a door.

- Banners and paitings depict clues to the secret rite. Assuming PCs did not go to the dormitory, reveal hear some secrets about the dragons' blessing and the rite using a chalice.

- __If PCs picked up and looked at the leather map,__ with a Survival WIS or History INT DC 12, PCs can figure out what is the purpose and explanation of the script etched into the leather map.
  Looking at the banners around the room it confirms that there is some kind of "recipe" for an elixir.
  And that the map marks the location that seems to be around the kitchen area near the cask.

- __If players examine the wine cask by opening it,__ Investigation INT DC 12 or Perception WIS DC 14, PCs can find a section of the cask that has a small compartment that blends to the overal structure. The compartment opens easily enough given some time, no check required.
  > As you open the compartment, there is an old-looking, yet shiny, goblet with engravings that match the depictions from the banners.
    A calm feeling washes over whomever holds it, and there is a suttle sweet scent almost like honey.
