The Zelda Formula
- 3, 5, 7
- 3 Artifacts to unlock the McGuffin
- the McGuffin is needed to defeat the BBE

- 5 artifacts to weaken or reverse enough of the evil wrought
- 7 is an extension, where a weapon or means of stopping the BBE is possible

* Simplified formula: 2, 4, 1
* 2 keys or halves to get the mcguffin
* 4 artifacts that represent forces or powers that will help defeat the BBE
* 1 , the 2 + 4 is needed to make one solution or means of defeating the BBE
* could also be the 1 hiddent talent that no one else was there
