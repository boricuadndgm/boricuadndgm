A party traveling across the desert with only minimal inventory resources.
Their travel began over 2 tendays ago and were headed to the sacred city of Al-Hambra in search of means to secure an alliance with the sultan.
Something went wrong, the trip wa only meant to take 12 days, and your guide Amir has traveled this route before (or so he says).
The group is low on resoureces (food/water).
On the trek, a raid of bandits tries to steal your supplies.
The attack ends up killing a large number in your group.
As night approaches, the guide mentions that you are near an oasis outpos and should be able to at least get more water and rest.
If asked, the guide mentions the shifting entity and mystery of the desert almost as if it is alive.
Amir also mentions that it is difficult to move as a group and that he could travel ahead and try to reach the city to bring help.
