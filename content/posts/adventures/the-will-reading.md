An adventure in Tocata Fugue G-Minor. (Wolf-howl and storm sounds).

You have been gathered for the execution/"reading" of the will and the players all have to gain from the will.
All inheritance will be given to who eer makes ti 3 days in the house.
However, the house is haunted and Baron Marron von Braun is dead and seems to have set free a group of spirits

The rewards is the Baron's "most priceless possession" a subjective object that has not true value.
