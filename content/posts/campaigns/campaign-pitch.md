# The Table Pitch

We want to play D&D and you have shown interest in this adventure or campaign.
I will do my best to articulate what kind of game I am currently formulating.
Adventures and campaigns will change over time; consequently, so will this article.

To read more <a href = "/boricuadndgm/about-me/">about me</a> in specific.

## Join Our D&D Adventure!

Are you ready to embark on an epic journey where your character's background and goals drive them to seek adventure, fame, influence, vengeance, riches, or any combination thereof?
**Become the champion the world needs!**

Your mission is to establish a local franchise of an adventuring guild and build its reputation to achieve regional impact.
Your characters are candidates applying to get a new business license, but first you must prove yourselves worthy through the internship program.

In this first adventure, you will attempt to gain favor with the local town council members by helping clear the mine from a recent monster infestation.

In our campaign, you will encounter thrilling situations of good versus evil, law and order versus anarchy and chaos.
Your actions will gain you reputation and renown with some factions, while potentially alienating others.

Among many things you can expect:

- Navigate the complex geopolitics, aligning with or against various factions that hoard power, wealth, and control.
- Explore dangerous dungeons in search of rare magical artifacts that boost the local and regional economy and elevate the prestige of your adventuring guild.
- Face horrible monsters and terrible threats to defend the townsfolk, villages, cities, and the realm itself.
- Beware of challengers and rival guilds or factions that may attempt to hinder your progress.

Join us and become part of an unforgettable adventure! üé≤üìú

## Character Creation Guidelines

Characters will be created with the older **D&D 5e 2014** rules.
This ensures that most of the material is available for folks.
I have Player Handbooks, Tasha's, and Xanathars, as well as, various other official books.
I am happy to help provide tools and reference materials for character creation.

We will **not** use the D&D 5e 2024 rules unless everyone agrees.
This is because not all the material has yet been converted over and I have not really read the updated rules yet.

Feel free to use any character tracking method you prefer.
I am a paper pencil type of person, so I am happy to provide character sheets.

This is all a conversation, so if you have questions, just ask. üëç
