# Session 1 Recap

* Met **Gordon**, Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, **Acquisitions, Inc**. Gordon acted as a welcome party and introduced you to the town council members looking to hire adventurers. Gordon is determined to help the party set up a franchise at all costs.
* Met **Marinella** town council members **Eva** and **Elias** who hired you to rid the local mine from a recent monster infestation.
* Eva secretly requested the party to find evidence of wrongdoing by the **TMM corporation**.
* Met **Sigrid** head of mining operations for TMM. Her main concern is to ensure miner safety and that the mines continue to operate as it is the livelihood of many locals.
* Interviewing Sigrid reveals that a recent mystery shipment coincides with the appearance of monsters in the mine. The monsters appear to be grotesque versions of normal beasts and are not sentient but highly ferocious.
* **Alicia** uncovered that at least one miner has died and others have been injured. Other miners have confirmed that weird things have been happening like people having headaches, hearing voices, and some suspect the food and water.
* **Theo** and **Cesar** investigated the water from the well which contained some weird dark tar-like substance. When the substance made contact with grass it began to wither.
* **Kairos** cleverly made contact with “Jay” , a suspicious character from corporate offices that has lost a ledger. “Jay” seems worried about the consequences with the corporation. A deal was struck to have the party retrieve the manifest in one of the break rooms.
* The party has entered the mine and so far have noticed the withering mushrooms that are meant to clean the air from hazardous gasses. In the next session, the party will begin investigating the \-1F sub level.
