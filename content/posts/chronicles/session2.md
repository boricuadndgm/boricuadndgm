# Session 2 Recap

**Descent into the Corrupted Mine**

- **Mine Cleanup and Initial Findings**:
  The party successfully cleared the first level (-1F) of the mine, eliminating all monsters near the surface.
  After their battle, they returned to the mining camp to rest and report their findings.

- **Mutated Beasts and Strange Effects**:
  While navigating the mine, the party encountered grotesque, mutated versions of typical creatures warped with tumors and boils.
  The creatures emitted a foul smell to match their appearance.
  The deeper the party ventured, the more they felt strange side effects creeping in, affecting their senses.

- **Disturbing Discovery—A Familiar Corruption**:
  __Cesar__ identified the foul odor and lingering effects as eerily similar to the dark tar-like substance that tainted the well.
  This realization is raising suspicions about a deeper corruption spreading through the mine.

- **Strategic Navigation and New Tools**:
  With caution, the party used torches to avoid igniting potential methane pockets.
  They managed to capture a **Giant Fire Beetle**, harnessing its glow for safer navigation, and discovered **Goggles of Night**, a valuable tool for improved vision in the darkness.

- **Mysterious Mushrooms and Unexpected Threats**:
  The party observed the withering **orange-hued mushrooms**, meant to provide natural light for the mine, appearing sickly and dying.
  Deeper in, they found a **variant mushrooms emitting a purple glow**, but these proved dangerous as they shrieked when exposed to light or proximity.
  Their deafening wails echoing through the tunnels attracted threatening hordes.

- **Investigations and Key Discoveries**:
  - **Kairos** carefully excavated one of these mysterious mushrooms, delivering it to **Sigrid**, who confirmed that they were not native to the mine and differed from the originally cultivated mushrooms meant to sustain air quality.
  - **Alicia** made an important find—she recovered a **key ring** hidden between storage boxes in the storeroom.
    While it holds several keys, it remains unclear which one unlocks the basement. Perhaps the key maker could lend some assistance.

With new dangers looming and unanswered mysteries deepening, the party prepares for their next descent into the mine’s dark and corrupted depths.
What secrets lie below? And how far has this corruption spread?
