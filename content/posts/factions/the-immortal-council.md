# The Immortal Council (IC)

## Why was the Immmortal Council made?

[Orcus], Prince of Undeath, aims to spread his army of undead servants to secure his domination in the Abyss and across the planes. [Orcus] sees the potential in having the most powerful liches be the ones to bring forth the doomsday event that is the invasion from the Abyss. The [IC] represents envoys in the material plane that create an ever growing army. Orcus has been a patron to members of the [IC] from the begining to serve as a foundation of "trust". All members of the [IC] have reason to betray one another, but resist to do while they have aligning interests. They all see potential in what [Orcus] has planned and see the value in having powerful allies against the forces of good.

## Who is a member of the Immortal Council?

### [Orcus]

[Orcus] is the key organizaer of the [IC]. He wants to use the [IC] as a way to create both sufficient forces for an invastion of the Abyss and other planes of existance. [Orcus], needs an army and the means of transporting the hordes of undead across the multiverse. [Orcus] sees the potential to fight the other [Demon Princes] with the undead army. Once he has gained control of the Abyss, he is looking to strike at the Devils in the [Nine Hells]. To achieve his goals, [Orcus] needs [Vecna] to build the [Planar Gate], a door to any plane of existence. [Acererak] is meant to provide the most powerful army of undead ever assembled. [Szass] and [Larloch] will ensure that the peoples of all nations are not able to notice the [IC]'s plans. Finally, [Dracoliches] will provide the resources to power the [Planar Gate].

### [Vecna]

[Vecna] sees [Orcus]' vast undead hordes as a means to bolster his own forces. In return, [Vecna]'s mastery of arcane secrets provides these agents of evil access to multiversal travel beyond the material planes. [Vecna] equally sees and opportunity to gain a foothold in the lower planes and access to demonic resources. [Vecna] is willing to help [Orcus] since he gave him the ritual to achieve lichdom, moreover, the circumstances favor [Vecna] as well since it would secure his place as a deity. [Vecna] sees himself as a partner to [Orcus] and not his servant.

### [Acererak]

[Acererak] was an apprentice of Vecna in his early days of working with necromancy. [Orcus] helped [Acererak] become a powerful lich by sharing arcane knowledge and rituals to raise and undead army. [Acererak], as a master of necromancy, has many experiments to create powerful undead creatures. [Acererak]'s temple, known as the [Tomb of Horrors], is built to honor [Orcus] and serves as the laboratory where new evil beings are born. [Acererak] aligns himself with [Orcus], as the patron that helped him achieve lichdom, and [Vecna] had been a good mentor when they were among the living. [Acererak] wants to steal the secrets for multiversal travel from [Vecna].

### [Szass Tam][Szass]

[Szass Tam][Szass] is the rightful leader of the [Red Wizards of Thay]. [Szass] is a machiavelian political strategist and dastardly cunning diplomat. He is the key to persuade noble houses and governments from mobilizing against the [IC]. [Szass] intends to manipulate circustances and events to distract the peoples and nations until the [IC] is ready to strike. [Szass] obtained his diplomatic status as ruler of Thay, the undead fiefdom. Unlike [Vecna] and [Acererak], [Szass] acquire the ritual for lichdom by working with Dracoliches.

### [Larloch]

[Larloch], master of spies, has a large and complex intelligence network all across the nations. His followers are embeded in all factions in the world. [Larloch] knows that controlling information secures his position on the [IC]. [Orcus] persuaded him with the ability to estabilsh his own domain in exchange for infiltrating [Celestials] and [Dragons]. Out of convenience, [Larloch] has been a long time lich partner to the Thaying wizards which have provided resources and cover for any mishaps. [Larloch] acquired lichdom by stealing the ritual from the Dracoliches.

### [Dracoliches]

The [Dracoliches] are not an organized group but rather entities of such power they discovered the rituals for lichdom without needing to seek [Orcus]' help. [Dracoliches] are beings whose Draconic Essense is concentrated in one body which is to say the price for immortality is existing only in one plane of existence. [Dracoliches] follow their draconic nature and just enjoy hoarding magical knowledge and treasures. [Dracoliches] pocess an immense cosmic power needed for a war at this magnitude. This magical resource that is powerful enough to supply the [Planar Gate] which [Vecna] is in charge to build. [Orcus] sees the alliance with [Szass] and [Larloch] as a way to bridge the relationship with [Dracoliches].

## Why doesn't the IC just immediately invade?

The [Gods], [Dragons], and [Celestials] have made safeguards to make multiversal travel nearly impossible. During the [1st War Against Chaos], the various humanoid factions allied to ensure that Demons, Devils, and other monstrosities would remain on their home planes. This led to the [Pact Primevil] and the [Etherial Veil] which enabled a long lasting peace and held at bay the monsters that would see the worlds surrender to chaos.

In times past, [Orcus]' attempts had been thwarted before they had a chance to take root. To prevent and corrupt from within, [Orcus] recruited the help of the [IC].

## Why doesn't the nations immediately fight?

[Szass]'s mission is to make it seem like the advances or encounters with undead creatures are to be interpreted as a naturally occurring expansion. [Szass] has partnered with [Larloch] to gather necessary intelligence on the rulers and politics of the nations to create conflict and discord.

## Why is the Material Plane so important?

Planar travel is somewhat similar to waves in which amplitude, frequency, and phases matter. Most 2D or 3D diagrams illustrate the planes as cocentric spheriods. This gives the impression that to traverse the planes one must travel a distance across one another. Let us examine the Inner Planes and the their primordial forces. The image 1.1 shows that the planes are interconnected. But to "move" between one to the other requires immense ammounts of energy to change the amplitude, frequency, phase of what is to travel between the 2. Planar energy is Bessel functions with variant amplitude and frequency and shifted phase.

The Material Plane exists at the center (origin) of whose ripples permeate across other planes with the largest amplituded. This means that from the MP, tuning forks that act as planar travel equipment work bes from the MP. And here lies the plan Orcus and Vecna have formulated. [Orcus] is bound to the Abyss but with the help from [Vecna] who has mastered planar travel magitek.
