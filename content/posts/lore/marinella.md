## Description

> Welcome to the seaside town of Marinella!
> At first glance, Marinella is a quaint fishing town at the southernmost edge of the region.
> The town was settled in the soft soil of a lagoon that opens up to the Meridian sea 🌊.
> Marinella has enjoyed unfettered access to the nearby achipelago and trading partners.
> As a result, the settlement has been a breeding ground for rampant piracy and smuggling.
> And while some disapprove of these brigands, others have enjoyed the alternate sources of income.
> To the north is a mountain range, the Vesperine Alps, which separates Marinella from the nearest powerful state.
> The state of Tyrol sees Marinella as a strategic and crucial financial ally and some say bondservants.
> And this is where you come in. Due to recent events the company finds itself ...a bit short staffed.
> No worries. It just means that hiring standards need to be adjusted.
> Lucky for us, we are seeking aggresive expansion in this adventuring business and this town's economy is perfectly situated.
