# The Town of Saltmarsh

> Welcome to the seaside town of Saltmarsh!
> At first glance, Saltmarsh is a quaint fishing town at the southernmost edge of the region.
> The town was settled in the soft soil of a lagoon that opens up to the Meridian sea ðŸŒŠ.
> Saltmarsh has enjoyed unfettered access to the nearby achipelago and trading partners.
> As a result, the settlement has been a breeding ground for rampant piracy and smuggling.
> And while some disapprove of these brigands, others have enjoyed the alternate sources of income.
> To the north is a mountain range, the Vesperine Alps, which separates Saltmarsh from the nearest powerful state.
> The state of Tyrol sees Saltmarsh as a strategic and crucial financial ally and some say bondservants.
> And this is where you coming....
