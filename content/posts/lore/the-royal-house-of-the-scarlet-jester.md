# The Royal House of the Scarlet Jester

A cursed and corrupted noble house that lost repute and was banished from civilized society.
They defied the other lords and attempted a coup by making deals with the Red Wizards.
Through this partnership they have delved into necromancy and hemocraft.

# Wants

Revenge, Control, Transcendence

- Control the trade wealth in the Marinella region
- Revenge against the other lords in Tyrol
- Transcend into immortality to avoid being stopped

# Need

- Collect large quantities of Dark Water in order to power a magical ritual that will raise an undead army.
- Also can be a way to obtain immortality by becoming a lich.

# Why don't they have it?

The lords and force of the Tyrol nation state have made sure to expel the RHS from their position of power.
In effect causing the operations of RHS to move underground.

The pirates who would trade with RHS have been weakened or removed from power.
Distablecing the pirate organizations to the point where there is very little trust with whom to make deals.

The means and rituals to become immortal are obscure to the point of myth.
Groups like the Red Wizards guard this secret above all else, but alude to the use of Dark Water.
Other avenues exist, Orcus, however, they have steep price.

Dark Water can only be collected from specific spots out at sea.
The number of pirates and smugglers willing to attempt such a dangerous collection is really small.
The number of pirates that have charts for these collection points is even smaller.
Tyrolian navy has been finding collection spots and guarding them.
