# Tyrol

[Tyrol] is a confederation of nation states ruled by a federal monarch, called Kaiser.
The Kaiser leads the various government bodies and presides over foreign policy.
Kaisers rule for a single term of 30 years and are usually elected from the Markgraves.
Each region has a Markgrave, who is the full authority and autonomy to rule within their domains.
Markgraves serve 20 years for a single term. The Kaiser and Markgraves make up the ruling class.
The central government body is called the _Großer Bundesländerrat_ which translates to _Grand Federal States Council_.
