Most settlements have a positive relationship with Marinella and would think themselves as allies.\nReal World Analog: Country and peoples of Italy Settlement Type: Town Settlement Size: a little over ~8k inhabitants Primary Industry: Fishing Sea Trade Smuggling (Piracy) Ship Building Other Industries: Mining (New Market) Nearby town and villages:\nBrescia Forli Monte Ricco Parma Perugia Ragusa Ravenna Region and Geography Southern most coastal town in the region of Marisma. The bay opens up to the [Meridian Sea] where there is a multitude of islands and other coastal territories. The region\u0026rsquo;s norther border is sealed by the [Vesperine Alps].\nThe Town Facts Welcome to the seaside town of Marinella! At first glance, Marinella is a quaint fishing town at the southernmost edge of the region. The town was settled in the soft soil of a lagoon that opens up to the Meridian sea üåä. Marinella has enjoyed unfettered access to the nearby achipelago and trading partners. As a result, the settlement has been a breeding ground for rampant piracy and smuggling. And while some disapprove of these brigands, others have enjoyed the alternate sources of income. To the north is a mountain range, the Vesperine Alps, which separates Marinella from the nearest powerful state. The state of Tyrol sees Marinella as a strategic and crucial financial ally and some say bondservants. And this is where you come in. Due to recent events the company finds itself \u0026hellip;a bit short staffed. No worries. It just means that hiring standards need to be adjusted. Lucky for us, we are seeking aggresive expansion in this adventuring business and this town\u0026rsquo;s economy is perfectly situated.\n\u0026ndash; Gordon F. Shrute, Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, Acquisitions, Inc.\nThe town is undergoing an economic boom. There are whole sections of the town being built on lagoon islands amidst the marshy landscape. The terrain depression allowed for the sea to flood the area where the delta of a major river and the see meld. The overall region is decently diverse with various communities focused on certain local villages. The mining operations are recent developments primarily influenced by Tyrol and TMM. The population and its leadership is broken down into two major factions Traditionalists and Loyalists. Both Traditionalists and Loyalist seek to influence the directions of the Consiglio Maggiore. The city is ruled by the Consiglio Maggiore (a.k.a town council). Governing bodies are represented in the council:\nTerraferma (land part of town) Marittima (island on the bay) Patricians (older founding families) Comerciantes (the merchants and traders) Tresoreria Finanzaria (the bankers) Notable NPCs Guild Representatives Gordon Flanders Shrute Male Elf (he/him), thin, tall, wears glasses, and has brown hair Adventuring Guild Assistant (to the) Regional Manager Has a penchant for mustard short-sleeved shirts and brown slacks Corporate yes-man and brown-nose, workaholic, mediocre competence level, and rude.

Gordon acted as a welcome party and introduced you to the town council members looking to hire adventurers. Gordon is determined to help the party set up a franchise at all costs. Met Marinella town council members Eva and Elias who hired you to rid the local mine from a recent monster infestation. Eva secretly requested the party to find evidence of wrongdoing by the TMM corporation. Met Sigrid head of mining operations for TMM. Her main concern is to ensure miner safety and that the mines continue to operate as it is the livelihood of many locals. Interviewing Sigrid reveals that a recent mystery shipment coincides with the appearance of monsters in the mine. The monsters appear to be grotesque versions of normal beasts and are not sentient but highly ferocious. Alicia uncovered that at least one miner has died and others have been injured. Other miners have confirmed that weird things have been happening like people having headaches, hearing voices, and some suspect the food and water. Theo and Cesar investigated the water from the well which contained some weird dark tar-like substance. When the substance made contact with grass it began to wither. Kairos cleverly made contact with ‚ÄúJay‚Äù , a suspicious character from corporate offices that has lost a ledger. ‚ÄúJay‚Äù seems worried about the consequences with the corporation. A deal was struck to have the party retrieve the manifest in one of the break rooms. The party has entered the mine and so far have noticed the withering mushrooms that are meant to clean the air from hazardous gasses. In the next session, the party will begin investigating the -1F sub level.

After their battle, they returned to the mining camp to rest and report their findings.\nMutated Beasts and Strange Effects: While navigating the mine, the party encountered grotesque, mutated versions of typical creatures warped with tumors and boils. The creatures emitted a foul smell to match their appearance. The deeper the party ventured, the more they felt strange side effects creeping in, affecting their senses.\nDisturbing Discovery‚ÄîA Familiar Corruption: Cesar identified the foul odor and lingering effects as eerily similar to the dark tar-like substance that tainted the well. This realization is raising suspicions about a deeper corruption spreading through the mine.\nStrategic Navigation and New Tools: With caution, the party used torches to avoid igniting potential methane pockets. They managed to capture a Giant Fire Beetle, harnessing its glow for safer navigation, and discovered Goggles of Night, a valuable tool for improved vision in the darkness.\nMysterious Mushrooms and Unexpected Threats: The party observed the withering orange-hued mushrooms, meant to provide natural light for the mine, appearing sickly and dying. Deeper in, they found a variant mushrooms emitting a purple glow, but these proved dangerous as they shrieked when exposed to light or proximity. Their deafening wails echoing through the tunnels attracted threatening hordes.\nInvestigations and Key Discoveries:\nKairos carefully excavated one of these mysterious mushrooms, delivering it to Sigrid, who confirmed that they were not native to the mine and differed from the originally cultivated mushrooms meant to sustain air quality. Alicia made an important find‚Äîshe recovered a key ring hidden between storage boxes in the storeroom. While it holds several keys, it remains unclear which one unlocks the basement. Perhaps the key maker could lend some assistance. Theo stayed behind in the mining camp investigating with what the blacksmith knows about the vault door that covers the entrance to the basement (-3F). With new dangers looming and unanswered mysteries deepening, the party prepares for their next descent into the mine‚Äôs dark and corrupted depths. What secrets lie below? And how far has this corruption spread?\n","date":"2023-11-02T12:00:00-06:00","permalink":"https://boricuadndgm.github.io/boricuadndgm/posts/chronicles/session2/","title":"Adventure Chronicle - Session 2: Mine Cleanup Crew"},{"content":"Quest Log Starting a Business Acquisitions, Inc has accepted your application to intern with the company.
